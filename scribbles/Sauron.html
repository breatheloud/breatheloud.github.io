<p>What chance does reason stand against the will of the economy?</p>
<p>If I were a betting man I’d put my money on the latter. Knowledge, stemming from great research, will convert over an insignificant percentage of people in this contest. As contradicting research will come out, funded by corporations and invoiced under the unsavoury guise of 'marketing' or another tasteless euphemism. The battle will rage on, filtered down to us screen-staring zombies by the <em>great</em> truth-bearers of our time: the News Corporation.  The cherry on top is just how much we continue to be manipulated, yet stroll around under the myth of free will.</p>

<p>Pinocchio needs to believe he is a real-boy in order for the story to carry on, but this is no fairy-tale.</p>
<p>What chance does the individual stand against corporate manipulation?
While we're munching away on our chicken nuggets and sugar-infused what-does-it-even-matter-where-it-came-from: we intrinsically know we're being poisoned, yet it is not enough.  It's not enough that we know we're doing far more harm to our body than good.  We cannot rely on our evolutionary defence system. It is a graduating mass suicide, all in the name of profits.
For what chance does an evolutionary mechanism stand against greed?</p>
<!-- Image of Sauron -->
<p>Greed is of course an evolutionary mechanism itself, but it has morphed into something wholly different now. Absolutely corrupted, it now infests everything it touches. This is the root sickness of the world.</p>
<p>This is why global warming will not cool down.  We now find ourselves in a sick hyper-capitalistic Mordor, what chance do men stand?</p>

“Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.”
